NEWS/Changelog

1.2-1	(under development)
    o	improve rendering on bitmap devices by aligning straight lines
	to the pixel grid and adding bleed to such fills.

    o	added wrappers that take exactly the same parameters as
	existing devices such as png, jpeg, pdf, postscript, X11 or
	windows and map them to calls to Cairo. They can be used to
	replace native devices by Cairo without the need to change
	existing code.

    o	added namespace

1.2-0
    o	additional interactive back ends: X11 (XLib) and win (Win32)

    o	enhanced back-end API to support interactive back-ends

    o	change default backgroud color to "white", because
	alpha-blending doesn't work properly in cairo when painting on
	purely transparent background.

    o	change the way filenames are interpreted, use multi-file
	printf convention as other devices do.

    o	added support for jpeg and tiff image formats
